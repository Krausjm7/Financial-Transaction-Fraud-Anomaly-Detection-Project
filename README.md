# Financial Transaction Fraud Anomaly Detection Project
This project builds and compares multiple machine learning models for fraud detection using a synthetic dataset of financial transactions. It trains and evaluates models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, HMM, and Isolation Forest, analyzing their performance to find the most effective approach.

## Synthetic Fraud Detection Dataset

## Project Files
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* `Synthetic_Data_Finanical_Transactions.csv`: The synthetic financial transaction data.
* `Fraud_Detection_Transactions_v2.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook building the ML models.
* `Trained Model Pickle Files`: Saved models for future predictions.

## Dependencies
This project relies on several popular Python libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. You'll need to install all of them before running the scripts.

You can install all the required libraries using a single pip command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn hmmlearn
