# Financial-Transaction-Fraud-Anomaly-Detection-Project
This project builds and compares multiple machine learning models for fraud detection using a synthetic dataset of financial transactions. It trains and evaluates models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, HMM, and Isolation Forest, analyzing their performance to find the most effective approach.

Synthetic Fraud Detection Dataset

It trains and evaluates models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, HMM, and Isolation Forest, analyzing their performance to find the most effective approach.

Files
generate_synthetic_data.py: The Python script used to generate the dataset.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Dependencies
This project relies on several popular Python libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. You'll need to install all of them before running the scripts.

You can install all the required libraries using a single pip command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn hmmlearn




How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the data generation script from your terminal:

python generate_synthetic_data.py




A CSV file named Synthetic_Data_Finanical_Transactions.csv will be generated in the same directory.
